# readMXE
Here in lives an **R** function to read MXE files generated by the Java version of MaxEnt, a program to fit ecological niche models using the Maximum Entropy approach.

The Java program MaxEnt is perhaps the most widely-used tool for producing Ecological/Environmental Niche Models (ENMs). The program produces raster GIS layers which hold ENM model scores in each gridcell. The program writes these files with the file extension ".mxe".

The MaxEnt Java program does provide some command line tools for translating these data into a small number of alternate GIS file formats, but does not allow these GIS layers to be saved in the widely-used *geoTIFF* format.

The **R** function *readMXE* parses the mxe file and stores the extracted data in an **R** list object. These data can be easily re-packaged and saved in a very wide range of GIS raster data types, but most importantly, they can be saved as a *geoTIFF* file with jsut a few lines fo code using **R** packages such as *raster* and *terra*.

Data extraction is possible because the mxe file is actually a standard Java datastream saved to disk. A first post about this realisation, and its consequences for writing some simple code to extract data from it, can be found here https://rpubs.com/puddleduck/67084.
